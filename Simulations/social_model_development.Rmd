# Background

We want to simulate an agent performing a binary perceptual decision task. Initially we follow @Rollwage2021 for the information sampling where the *i*th agent samples perceptual information ($X_i$) as given by a normal distribution $X_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2_i)$. The value of $\mu$ is always fixed on the real world state (i.e. the perceptual stimulus) and thus lacks a subscript but the value of $\sigma^2$ varies according to the agent capability in the task. The agent then makes a decision based solely on this information $X_i$. The decision is defined by the sign of $X_i$ where $decision_i = 1$ if $X_i > 0$ or $decision_i = -1$ if $X_i < 0$.
Each agent has a given confidence in its own decision. As a first approximation we can compute confidence as the log-odds ($LO_i$) in favor of the chosen world state [@Rollwage2021] given by $LO_i = \frac{2\mu X_i}{\sigma^2_i}$. We can transform $LO_i$ to reflect the probability of being correct which we will refer to as the agent confidence from now on, thus the *i*th agent confidence in their decision is given by the log-odds transformation $confidence_i = \frac{e^{LO_i}}{1+e^{LO_i}}$. This measure constitutes a noiseless confidence computed directly from the sampled information and reflects an agent with an optimal confidence. 

After sampling information and computing confidence, the agent is exposed to social information in the form of frequencies of decisions made by other agents. The task for the agent afterwards is to integrate both sources of information, personal/individual and social. The information integration model from @Rollwage2021 cannot be used since the agent does not have access to the information sampled by the other agents nor the parameters governing the other agents sampling process. We instead rely on the model proposed by @Toyokawa2019 where we model the probability of the *i*th agent choosing the _m_ option. The original model states that the probability of individual _i_ of choosing the option _m_ at time _t_ is given by a weighted average defined by the following formula

$P_{i.t}(m)=\sigma_{i,t} \times$ social influence<sub>i,m,t</sub>$+(1-\sigma_{i,t}) \times$ asocial influence<sub>i,m,t</sub>

where $\sigma_{i,t}$ represents the weight given to social information by the _i_ individual at time _t_. Social influence<sub>i,m,t</sub> represents the amount of social information given by the frequencies associated with each option and is defined as Social influence<sub>i,m,t</sub>$=\frac{(F_{t-1}(m)+0.1)^\theta}{\Sigma_{k \in options}(F_{t-1}(k)+0.1)^\theta}$. That is because in the task performed by @Toyokawa2019 the participants could only see the decisions made by others in the preceding round and there were more than two options to choose from. Lastly asocial influence<sub>i,m,t</sub> represents the amount of individual information which was computed using a standard reinforcement learning with ‘softmax’ choice rule where participants update the estimated average reward of a given option according to the Rescorla–Wagner rule. We choose to avoid expressing the formula that defines asocial influence for simplicity since we are trying to simulate a different type of task and have already defined the way our agent samples individual information. 

We tweak the aforementioned model to our use case. For clarity sake we modify the notation of what @Toyokawa2019 calls the social learning weight $\sigma$. Since for our purposes $\sigma$ represents the standard deviation of the normal distribution that governs the agents information sampling process, we instead employ the greek letter $\alpha$ to indicate the weight given to social information. Furthermore, we incorporate several definitions of $\alpha$ in our model. As a simple and first approach we explore different levels of alpha $[0, 0.9]$ in intervals of 0.1. On one end when $\alpha = 0$ the agent completely ignores it's own decision and relies entirely on social information, choosing the option with the highest frequency. On the other end when $\alpha = 0.9$ the agent pays very little attention to social information and weights heavily its own information. As a second approach we model $\alpha$ to be exactly equal to the agent confidence (as the probability of being correct).  
We will call what @Toyokawa2019 calls the asocial influence, the individual information and represent it as $A$. We define $A$ in terms of $X_i$ but since we need to deal with probabilities we will transform $X_i$ to $A = \frac{e^{X_i}}{1+e^{X_i}}$. 
Social influence will be defined as $S$ and we use the same formula as @Toyokawa with $\theta$ fixed at 1 and eliminating the $+ 0.1$ term. As a result we have simply that $S$ is the relative frequency of option _m_. Since we deal with a binary decision task we can drop the reference to the option _m_ ($S$ instead of $S(m)$) since given one frequency the other is completely determined by its complement. When computing $S$ in this way the total number of agents does not modify in any way the social influence strength since 7 out of 10 will give the same result as 700 out of 1000. 

The final integration model will then be

$P = (1-\alpha) \times S(m) + \alpha \times A$

where $P$ equals the probability to decide for option 1. The final decision $decision_{final}$ can be conceptualized as a deterministic process where $decision_{final} = 1$ if $P > 0.5$ and $decision_{final} = -1$ otherwise or as a random process given by a Binomial $decision_{final} \sim Bin(1,p)$ where $p=P=(1-\alpha) \times S(m) + \alpha \times A$.  

Instead of defining $\sigma^2$ directly we specify different levels of information strengths $[0.3-1.2]$ given by $\frac{\mu}{\sigma}$ [@Rollwage2021] and given that we fixed $\mu$ to be 1 this would be equivalent to $\frac{1}{\sigma}$ which similar to the reliability metric defined by @Toelch2015. In this way, we can assess the impact of different levels of information reliability independent of the specific values of $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$.

Since in `R` we define the normal distribution in terms of its standard deviation ($\sigma$), we can compute the appropriate standard deviation that defines the distribution with the appropriate strength level by using this simple calculation $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{\sigma}}$ which is basically $strength^{-1}$. 


```{r}
roll_mu <- 1 #We call it roll in reference to the author Rollwage
strength_levels <- seq(0.3,1.2,0.1)
sigmas <- roll_mu/strength_levels #Calculate the appropiate standard deviations
```

To provide the agent with social influence we need to determine how many people will also be participating, for exploration purposes we used an interval ranging from 5 to 10000. 

```{r}
others <- c(5,10,20,50,100,200,500,1000,5000,10000)
```

Now we construct a function to mimic the sampling of information in sequential trials. The function takes as arguments a $\mu$ and $sigma$ value along with a parameter `n_trials` to define the number of trials to simulate. It returns several values. First of all the function returns the $X_i$ value as it was previously defined. Second it returns the decision taken by the ith agent which is defined by $X_i$, if $X_i > 0$ then $decision =1$, otherwise ($X_i < 0$) $decision = -1$. Thirdly, we compute the log odds in favour of the chosen world state [@Rollwage2021] defined as $LO = \frac{2\mu X_i}{\sigma^2_i}$. Finally the function calculates and returns the probability of being correct for the agent ($confidence$) which is the transformed log odds given by $confidence = \frac{e^{LO}}{(1+e^{LO})} $. The function also returns the information strength for that individual trial. Each of these outputs is given as a column in the resulting dataframe.

```{r}
roll_agent_sampler <- function(n_trials, mu_value, sigma_value){
  x_ind <- rnorm(n_trials, mu_value, sigma_value)
  decisions_ind <- ifelse(x_ind > 0, 1, -1)
  log_odds_ind <- (2*mu_value*x_ind)/(sigma_value^2)
  confidence_ind <- exp(log_odds_ind)/(1+exp(log_odds_ind))
  res_df <- data.frame(
    X = x_ind,
    decision = decisions_ind,
    logodds = log_odds_ind,
    prob_correct = confidence_ind,
    strength = mu_value/sigma_value
  )
  return(res_df)
}
```

# Individual simulation

We now simulate 20000 trials for each individual $\sigma^2$ value.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
individual_performance <- map(
  sigmas,
  ~ roll_agent_sampler(100000, roll_mu, .x)
) %>%
  bind_rows()
```

We compute the accuracy of each decision which, since $\mu = 1$ according to the real world state is equivalent to check if the agent decision is equal to 1. 

```{r}
individual_performance <- individual_performance %>%
  mutate(accuracy = as.numeric(decision == 1))
```

## Results

Now we can calculate how the mean accuracy changes as a function of information strength. 

```{r}
individual_performance %>% group_by(strength) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_acc = mean(accuracy)
            )
```

As expected the accuracy increases with information strength, that is with lower $\sigma^2$ values.

We can also check the distribution of the agent confidence (as the probability of being correct) by each strength level. 

```{r}
  ggplot(
  data = individual_performance,
  aes(x = prob_correct, y = factor(strength), fill = factor(decision))
) +
  geom_density_ridges()
```

To test the calibration of the agent confidence we can binnarize the probability of being correct in intervals of .10 and compute the average accuracy for each case. 

```{r}
individual_performance %>% 
  mutate(
    prob_correct = as.numeric(substr(prob_correct, start = 1, 3))
         ) %>%
  group_by(prob_correct) %>%
  summarise(mean_accuracy = mean(accuracy)) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = prob_correct,
    y = mean_accuracy)
  ) +
  geom_line()
```


# Social influence simulation

Now we create a function to perform the trials that have social influence. The function takes the following arguments:

* `n_trials` = The number of trials to simulate for one combination of parameters. It is 2000 by default.
* `n_people` = The number of agents exerting influence.
* `mu_value` = The parameter $\mu$ that drives the sampling of individual information.
* `sigma_value` = The parameter $\sigma$ that determines the information strength. 

```{r}
social_influence_decision <- function(n_trials = 2000, n_people, mu_value, sigma_value){
  #The agent performs their individual information sampling
  agent_decisions <- roll_agent_sampler(n_trials, mu_value, sigma_value)
  
  #The other n agents perform their decisions
  others_decisions <- replicate(
   n_trials, #We perform the same number of decisions as the agent
   roll_agent_sampler(n_people, mu_value, sigma_value) %>% #Create each decision
    mutate(
      decision = factor(decision, levels = c(1,-1)) #Transform the decision column in a factor an define both levels
      ) %>% 
    count(decision, .drop = FALSE) %>% #We count how many agents decided for each option including 0 count values
    mutate(
      relative = n/sum(n)
      ), #Compute the relative frequency
   simplify = FALSE #Get the results as a list of dataframes
  ) %>%
  bind_rows() %>% #Bind all the dataframes into one
  mutate(decision = ifelse(decision == 1, 'a','b'), #Modify the decision name from a number to a name
         id = rep(seq(1,n_trials),each = 2) #Create an id to identify each trial
         ) %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = id, names_from = decision, values_from = relative) #Get the dataframe into wide format
  
  #Add the two dataframes together and use this as output
  cbind(agent_decisions, others_decisions) %>% dplyr::select(!id)
}
```

We need to also generate the functions to calculate the final decision value $P$. This function takes as input:

* `individual_information` = The raw $X_i$ value 
* `option_a` = The relative frequency of people selecting the optimal choice
* `social_weight` = The social information weight (from 0 to 1)

It returns a single value which the final information integration.

```{r}
final_decision <- function(individual_information, option_a, social_weight){
  transformed_ind <- exp(individual_information)/(1+exp(individual_information)) #Transformation of X
  
  social_information <- (1-social_weight)*option_a #Calculate social information value
  
  social_information+(social_weight*transformed_ind) #Compute and return the final information integration (calculation of asocial information is implicit)
}
```

To run the simulation we contemplate all the combinations of information strength values and the number of people. 

```{r}
strength_weight_combination <- expand.grid(sigmas, others)
```

We iterate over each combination and save the resulting dataframe in the `social_decision_weight` variable. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
social_decision_weight <- pmap(
  strength_weight_combination,
  ~ social_influence_decision(10000, .y, 1, .x) %>%
    mutate(n_agents = .y)
) %>% bind_rows()
save(social_decision_weight, file = 'SimpleSocialResult.rda')
```

Now we iterate over different values of the social weight parameter. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
final_decisions <- map(
  seq(0.1,1,0.1),
  ~ social_decision_weight %>% 
    mutate(
      weight = .x,
      trans_X = prob_correct,
      weight_P = (.x*a)+((1-.x)*trans_X),
      conf_P = ((1-prob_correct)*a)+(prob_correct*trans_X),
      deterministic_weight = ifelse(weight_P > 0.5, 1, 0),
      deterministic_conf = ifelse(conf_P > 0.5, 1, 0),
      prob_weight = rbinom(1,1, weight_P),
      prob_conf = rbinom(1,1,conf_P)
    )
) %>% bind_rows()
```

We compute the transformed value of $X_i$ that will be used in the information integration equation previously described. We also compute the value of the information integration (`conf_P`) using agent confidence as the weighting value and with that value calculate the final decision in deterministic and probabilistic terms. The `final_decision` function computes this same value (`conf_P`) but does not return the specific ingredients used in its calculation so we re-implement them here to check the specific values of each component.

```{r}
social_decision_weight <- social_decision_weight %>%
  mutate(
      trans_X = prob_correct,
      asocial_info = prob_correct*trans_X,
      social_info = (1-prob_correct)*a,
      conf_P = social_info + asocial_info,
      deterministic_conf = ifelse(conf_P > 0.5, 1, 0),
      prob_conf = rbinom(1,1,conf_P)
  )
```

## Results

```{r}
final_decisions %>% group_by(n_agents, weight, strength) %>%
  summarise(mean_acc = mean(deterministic_weight)) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = strength,
        y = weight,
        fill = mean_acc)
  ) +
  geom_tile() +
  facet_wrap(~n_agents) +
  scale_fill_viridis()
```

```{r}
final_decisions %>% group_by(n_agents, weight, strength) %>%
  summarise(mean_acc = mean(deterministic_weight)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(n_agents, strength) %>%
  filter(mean_acc == max(mean_acc)) %>%
  arrange(n_agents, strength) %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(x = strength,
        y = factor(n_agents),
        fill = weight)
  ) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_viridis()
```



First we check how group accuracy changes with the value of $\sigma^2$ and the number of agents.

```{r}
social_decision_weight %>%
  mutate(group_accuracy = ifelse(a > 0.5, 1, 0)) %>%
  group_by(n_agents, strength) %>%
  summarise(mean_acc = mean(group_accuracy)) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = strength, y = factor(n_agents), fill = mean_acc)
  ) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_viridis() +
  xlab('Information strength') + ylab('Number of agents')
```

Accuracy increases with both the number of agents and the information strength. Even with the lowest information strength, accuracy peaks at around 200 agents. For the lowest number of agents, the increase in accuracy is more gradual but still peaks at the higher information strength to a value near 1. 

We can also plot the final social information value as the information strength and number of agents varies. 

```{r}
social_decision_weight %>%
  group_by(strength, n_agents) %>%
  summarise(mean_social = mean(social_info)) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = strength, y = factor(n_agents), fill = mean_social)
  ) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_viridis()
```


We can now calculate the mean accuracy of the final decision by the number of agents and the strength of information.

```{r}
social_decision_weight %>%
  group_by(strength, n_agents) %>%
  summarise(mean_acc = mean(deterministic_conf == 1)) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = strength, y = factor(n_agents), fill = mean_acc)
  ) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_viridis()
```

Independent of the number of agents, as the information strength increases the mean accuracy of the response also increases. However when the information strength is fixed, the dynamics as the number of agents increaes differ depending on the specific information strength. 

To better assess this dynamics we can plot the same information but using lines to reflect the accuracy change.  

```{r}
social_decision_weight %>%
  group_by(strength, n_agents) %>%
  summarise(mean_acc = mean(deterministic_conf == 1)) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = n_agents, y = mean_acc, color = factor(strength))
  ) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
  xlab('Number of agents') + ylab('Mean Accuracy')
```

Furthermore we can compute the mean difference in the accuracy of the final response compared to the individual response and the group response. 

```{r}
social_decision_weight %>%
  group_by(strength, n_agents) %>%
  summarise(mean_final_acc = mean(deterministic_conf == 1),
            mean_ind_acc = mean(decision == 1),
            mean_group_acc = mean(a > 0.5)) %>%
  mutate(ind_diff = mean_final_acc - mean_ind_acc,
         group_diff = mean_final_acc - mean_group_acc) %>%
  dplyr::select(strength, n_agents, ind_diff, group_diff) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(ind_diff, group_diff), names_to = 'Difference') %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(y = value, x = n_agents, color = factor(strength))
  ) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = 'dashed') +
  facet_wrap(~Difference, scales = "free_y") +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
  theme_classic()
```

It will be useful to calculate the frequency with which the agent changes its own decision and goes with the group decision. 

```{r}
social_decision_weight %>%
  mutate(
      decision = ifelse(decision == 1, 1, 0),
      change = ifelse(decision == deterministic_conf, 0, 1)
  ) %>%
  group_by(strength, n_agents) %>%
  summarise(mean_change = mean(change)) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = factor(n_agents), y = strength, fill = mean_change)
  ) +
  geom_tile() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_viridis()
```

```{r}
social_decision_weight %>%
  mutate(
      decision = ifelse(decision == 1, 1, 0),
      change = ifelse(decision == deterministic_conf, 0, 1)
  ) %>%
  group_by(strength, n_agents) %>%
  summarise(mean_change = mean(change)) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = strength,
      y = mean_change,
      color = factor(n_agents)
    )
  ) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
  theme_classic()
```



```{r, eval = FALSE}
#Save the simulation results to continue withouth running the simulations all over again
save(final_decisions, individual_performance, social_decision_weight, file = "SimpleSocialResult.rda")
```

# Metacognitive agent

We create a function to replicate the metacognitive agent described by @Rollwage2021. 

The function takes the following inputs:

* n_trials: The amount of trials for each individual agent to perform 
* mu_value: A single number indicating the mean value of the normal multivariate distribution. This value will be copied to conform the vector of lenth two representing the mean for all the dimensions of the normal multivariate distribution, thus the mean value cannot vary independently over each dimension.
* inf_sigma: The value of $\sigma_{act}$ representing the noise in the individual (perceptual) information. 
* conf_sigma: The value of $\sigma_{conf}$ representing the noise in the individual confidence estimate. 
* rho: The value of $\rho$ representing the amount of correlation between the two dimensions (individual information and confidence estimate) of the bivariate normal distribution. This number multiplies both $\sigma$ values in the off-diagonal of the covariance matrix. 



```{r}
metacog_agent_sampler <- function(n_trials, mu_value, inf_sigma, conf_sigma, rho, metacog, strength = 0.8){
  mu_values <- rep(mu_value, 2)
  sigma_matrix <- matrix(
    c(
    inf_sigma^2, #variance of the individual information sample
    rho*inf_sigma*conf_sigma, #correlation between information and confidence
    rho*inf_sigma*conf_sigma, #idem
    conf_sigma^2), #variance of the confidence estimate
    2,
    2
  )
  x_samples <- mvrnorm(n_trials, mu_values, sigma_matrix)
  data.frame(x_inf = x_samples[,1],
             x_conf = x_samples[,2],
             inf_sigma = inf_sigma,
             conf_sigma = conf_sigma,
             rho = rho,
             coeficiente = conf_sigma/inf_sigma,
             metacog = metacog,
             decision = ifelse(x_samples[,1] > 0, 1, -1),
             strength = strength,
             true_value = mu_value
             )
}
```

Following @Rollwage2021 we create a function to define meta-d/d ratio values from 0.4 to 1.4. The function also takes as input a strength level present in the vector `strength_levels` to match the appropiate $\sigma$ values. 

```{r}
metacognitive_values_definition <- function(information_strength){
  metacog_strength <- sigmas[which(abs(strength_levels - information_strength) < 0.1e-10)]
  different_sigmas <- expand.grid(
    metacog_strength, 
    c(2.04, 1.54, 1.23)
    ) %>% 
    mutate(conf_sigma = Var1*Var2, rho = 0.8,
           metacog = c(0.4,0.6,0.8)) %>%
    rename(inf_sigma = Var1, 
           coefficients = Var2)
  different_rho <- expand.grid(
    c(0.1,0.3,0.5,0.65),
    metacog_strength
    ) %>%
    rename(rho = Var1,
           inf_sigma = Var2
    ) %>%
    mutate(conf_sigma = inf_sigma,
           coefficients = 1,
           metacog = c(1.4, 1.3, 1.2, 1.1))
  fixed_ratio <- data.frame(
    rho = 1,
    coefficients = 1,
    inf_sigma = metacog_strength,
    conf_sigma = metacog_strength,
    metacog = 1
  )
  final_values <- rbind(
    different_rho, different_sigmas, fixed_ratio
  )
  return(final_values)
}
```


To explore the behavior of each type of agent we employ three different levels of information strength. 


```{r}
strength_comparison <- c(0.3,0.6,0.9)
metacoginitive_values_test <- lapply(
  strength_comparison,
  function(x) metacognitive_values_definition(x) %>% mutate(strength = x)
) %>% bind_rows()
```


We now iterate over each combination of values computing 10 thousand trials for each. 


```{r}
metacog_test <- pmap(metacoginitive_values_test,
     ~ metacog_agent_sampler(10000, 1, ..2, ..3, ..1, ..5, ..6)
     ) %>%
  bind_rows() %>%
  mutate(accuracy = ifelse(decision == true_value, 1, 0))
```

We compare overall performance across each agent and expect to see the same level of accuracy.

```{r}
metacog_test %>%
  group_by(metacog, strength) %>%
  summarise(mean_acc = mean(accuracy)) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = factor(metacog), y = mean_acc, fill = factor(strength))
  ) +
  geom_col(position = 'dodge') +
  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE)
```

We create a function to compute the confidence of each agent in its decision.


```{r}
confidence_calculation <- function(x_conf, x_act, sigma_act, sigma_conf, rho){
  posible_d <- c(-1,1)
  numerator <- rep(NA,2)
  a <- ifelse(x_act > 0, 1, -1)
  indice <- 1
  for(d in posible_d){
    mu_second_term <- d + (sigma_act/sigma_conf)*rho*(x_conf - d)
    sigma_second_term <- sqrt((1-rho^2)*sigma_act^2)
    if(a == 1){
      second_term <- 1-pnorm(0, mu_second_term, sigma_second_term) 
    }
    else{
      second_term <- pnorm(0, mu_second_term, sigma_second_term)
    }
    first_term <- dnorm(x_conf, d, sigma_conf)
    numerator[indice] <- first_term*second_term
    indice <- indice + 1
  }
  if(a == 1){
    return(numerator[2]/sum(numerator))
  }
  else{
    return(numerator[1]/sum(numerator))
  }
}
```


We calculate each agents confidence.

```{r}
metacog_test$confidence <-  metacog_test %>%
  pmap(
    ~ confidence_calculation(..2, ..1, ..3, ..4, ..5)
  ) %>% unlist()
```

With confidence already computed we can compare the confidence score distribution by decision type (either 1 or -1) for each meta-d/d ratio and information strength combination.

```{r}
metacog_test %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = confidence, y = factor(metacog), fill = factor(decision))

## Results

The meta-d/d ratio of the agent with values of $\rho = 1$ and $\sigma_{act}=\sigma_{conf}$ should be 1. The same as the optimal agent that calculates confidence directly from $X_{act}$. However, confidence is calculated using two different approaches in each case. 

We should then compare the metrics for both agents with the two different methods. First of all we integrate their results into a single dataframe.

```{r}
optimal_agents_comparison <- rbind(
  #First Dataframe
  metacog_test %>% 
    filter(metacog == 1) %>% 
    dplyr::select(confidence, new_confidence, decision, strength) %>% 
    mutate(unbiased = 0),
  #Second Dataframe
  individual_performance %>% 
    filter(
      near(strength, strength_comparison)
    ) %>% 
    group_by(strength) %>%
    slice_sample(n = 10000) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    dplyr::select(decision, prob_correct, strength) %>%
    mutate(new_confidence = prob_correct,
           unbiased = 1) %>%
    rename(confidence = prob_correct)
  )
```

First we start by comparing the distributions of confidence values

```{r}
ggplot(
  optimal_agents_comparison,
  aes(x = confidence, y = factor(strength), color = factor(decision))
) +
  geom_density_ridges(stat = 'binline', fill = 'white', alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~unbiased) +
  theme_classic()
```



Then we compare the average performance between the two

```{r}
ggplot(
  optimal_agents_comparison,
  aes(x = factor(unbiased), y = accuracy)
) +
  stat_summary(geom = 'col') +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,1))
```


```{r}
metacog_test %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(confidence, new_confidence)) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = value, y = factor(metacog), fill = name)
  ) +
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5)
```



```{r, warning=FALSE}
metacog_test %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(confidence, new_confidence)) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(y = accuracy, x = value, color = factor(metacog))
  ) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'glm', method.args = list(family = "binomial"), 
    se = FALSE) +
  scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
  facet_wrap(~name)
```

```{r}
metacog_test %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(y = decision, x = confidence, color = factor(metacog))
  ) +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE)
```



```{r}
metacog_test %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = x_inf, y = x_conf)
  ) +
  geom_density2d() +
  facet_wrap(~metacog)
```



```{r}
metacog_test %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = factor(metacog), y = accuracy)
  ) +
  stat_summary(geom = 'pointrange')
```


# Metacognitive agents with social information

```{r}
load("SocialInfluenceMetacognition.rda")
```

The idea behind this simulation is that we need to generate a trial from a metacognitive agent using the `metacog_agent_sampler` function. In that same "trial" we generate a decision from other agents using the `roll_agent_sampler` function. 

We wrap this whole process inside a function called `metacog_social_influence_decision`. This function is similar to the `social_influence_decision` function but changes the individual agent function.

```{r}
metacog_social_influence_decision <- function(n_trials, mu_value, inf_sigma, conf_sigma, rho, metacog, n_people){
  
  #The agent performs their individual information sampling
  agent_decisions <- metacog_agent_sampler(n_trials, mu_value, inf_sigma, conf_sigma, rho, metacog)
  
  #The other n agents perform their decisions
  others_decisions <- replicate(
   n_trials, #We perform the same number of decisions as the agent
   roll_agent_sampler(n_people, mu_value, inf_sigma) %>% #Create each decision
    mutate(
      decision = factor(decision, levels = c(1,-1)) #Transform the decision column in a factor an define both levels
      ) %>% 
    count(decision, .drop = FALSE) %>% #We count how many agents decided for each option including 0 count values
    mutate(
      relative = n/sum(n)
      ), #Compute the relative frequency
   simplify = FALSE #Get the results as a list of dataframes
  ) %>%
  bind_rows() %>% #Bind all the dataframes into one
  mutate(decision = ifelse(decision == 1, 'a','b'), #Modify the decision name from a number to a name
         id = rep(seq(1,n_trials),each = 2) #Create an id to identify each trial
         ) %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = id, names_from = decision, values_from = relative) #Get the dataframe into wide format
  
  #Add the two dataframes together and use this as output
  return(cbind(agent_decisions, others_decisions) %>% dplyr::select(!id))
}
```

We need to repeat the rows from the `metacognitive_values` dataframe to accomodate the 10 different levels of agents introducing social information. Once done we add a new column called `n_agents` with a value corresponding to the number of people providing social influence in each parameter combination.

```{r}
metacognitive_values <- metacognitive_values_definition(0.3)
metacognitive_values <- metacoginitive_values_test %>% slice(rep(1:nrow(metacognitive_values), each = 10))
metacognitive_values <- metacognitive_values %>% mutate(
  n_agents = rep(others, 24)
)
```

We run the simulation using 4 cores and save the final result. 

```{r}
# library(furrr)
# plan(multisession(workers = 4))
# test <- furrr::future_pmap(
#   metacognitive_values,
#   ~ metacog_social_influence_decision(10000, 1, ..2, ..3, ..1, ..5, ..6) %>%
#     mutate(n_agents = ..6),
#   .progress = TRUE,
#   seed = TRUE
# ) %>% bind_rows()
test <- pmap(
  metacognitive_values %>% dplyr::select(!strength),
  ~ metacog_social_influence_decision(5000, 1, ..2, ..3, ..1, ..5, ..6) %>%
    mutate(n_agents = ..6)
) %>% bind_rows()
save(test, file = "SocialInfluenceMetacognition3.rda")
```

Calculate confidence for each agent used in the simulation

```{r}
test$confidence <-  test %>%
  pmap(
    ~ confidence_calculation(..2, ..1, ..3, ..4, ..5)
  ) %>% unlist()
```

Compute all the elements neccesary for the final decision of each agent. 

```{r}
test <- test %>% 
  mutate(
      trans_X = exp(x_inf)/(1+exp(x_inf)),
      asocial_info = confidence*trans_X,
      social_info = (1-confidence)*a,
      conf_P = social_info + asocial_info,
      deterministic_conf = ifelse(conf_P > 0.5, 1, -1),
      prob_conf = rbinom(1,1,conf_P),
      ind_accuracy = ifelse(decision == 1, 1, 0),
      group_accuracy = ifelse(a > 0.5, 1, 0),
      final_accuracy = ifelse(deterministic_conf == 1, 1, 0)
  )

```

```{r}
test2 <- left_join(
  test %>% dplyr::select(!strength),
  metacognitive_values %>% dplyr::select(inf_sigma, conf_sigma, strength) %>% distinct(.keep_all = T),
  by = c('inf_sigma','conf_sigma')
)
```


```{r}
test2 <- test2 %>%
  mutate(
      new_a = new_frequency_function(a, n_agents),
      trans_X = exp(x_inf)/(1+exp(x_inf)),
      asocial_info = confidence*trans_X,
      social_info = (1-confidence)*new_a,
      conf_P = social_info + asocial_info,
      deterministic_conf = ifelse(conf_P > 0.5, 1, -1),
      prob_conf = rbinom(1,1,conf_P),
      ind_accuracy = ifelse(decision == 1, 1, 0),
      group_accuracy = ifelse(a > 0.5, 1, 0),
      final_accuracy = ifelse(deterministic_conf == 1, 1, 0)
  )
```


Compare average accuracy values for each metacognitive efficiency parameter value

## Different decision computation

```{r}
new_frequency_function <- function(prop_a, n_agents, output = 'a'){
  freq_a <- prop_a*n_agents
  freq_b <- n_agents-freq_a
  
  new_freq_a <- freq_a^log(n_agents)
  new_freq_b <- freq_b^log(n_agents)
  common_denominator <- new_freq_a + new_freq_b
  new_prop_a <- new_freq_a/common_denominator
  new_prop_b <- new_freq_b/common_denominator
  
  if(output == 'a'){
    return(new_prop_a)
  }
  else{
    return(new_prop_b)
  }
}
```

We recompute the frequency of each option by exponentiating each number to the natural log of the number of agents and thus recompute all the decision process.


```{r}
test2 <- test %>% 
  mutate(
      new_a = new_frequency_function(a, n_agents),
      trans_X = exp(x_inf)/(1+exp(x_inf)),
      asocial_info = confidence*trans_X,
      social_info = (1-confidence)*new_a,
      conf_P = social_info + asocial_info,
      deterministic_conf = ifelse(conf_P > 0.5, 1, -1),
      prob_conf = rbinom(1,1,conf_P),
      ind_accuracy = ifelse(decision == 1, 1, 0),
      group_accuracy = ifelse(a > 0.5, 1, 0),
      final_accuracy = ifelse(deterministic_conf == 1, 1, 0)
  )
```


```{r}
test2 %>% group_by(metacog, n_agents) %>%
  summarise(mean_final_acc = mean(final_accuracy)) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = factor(n_agents), y = factor(metacog), fill = mean_final_acc)
  ) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_viridis()
```
